    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
             <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
             <li>8 slices white bread</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
             <li>8 slices deli ham</li>
             <li>4 large slices Swiss cheese</li>
             <li>8 dill pickle slices</li> 
             <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread. With mayo side down, lightly spread 4 slices of bread with Dijon mustard, evenly top each with Swiss cheese, ham slices, folded to fit, and pickle slices. Place the remaining 4 bread slices on the sandwiches, mayo side up, and lightly press sandwiches to close.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray or line with a parchment liner.</li>        
            <li>Place sandwiches in the air fryer basket in a single layer, leaving some space around them. You may have to cook the sandwiches in batches, depending on the size of your fryer. </li>
            <li>Cook until sandwiches begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, and cook until cheese has melted and sandwiches are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Slice sandwiches in half and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
